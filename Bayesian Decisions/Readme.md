# Bayesian Decisions

1. First, we are going to code mean, standard deviation, sampleMean and covariance from scratch for
util.py. 


2. Next, we create classifiers.py. 

For testing:
    
(a) Created a pandas dataframe with one feature column (“Heart-Rate”) and one
class column with 1,000 total samples. The class column contains two
classes (“Stress” and ”Not Stress”) with 430 samples corresponding to “Stress”.
The average heart-rate data for “Stress” is be 110 and the average heart-
rate data for ”Not Stress” is be 65.

(b) Used the pandas groupby and described methods to ensure the dataframe has the
expected characteristics 

(c)Tested Prior Classifier with the dataframe and ensured the predict function
worked as expected for inputs ranging from 40 to 140.
